# About This Website

Yes, I know there are a lot of site creation tools out there, designed to make appealing portfolio websites.

I'm a programmer, not a graphics designer. I'm much more at home dealing with code than with WYSIWYG editors.

Therefore, this website is written in React. The current web page is written in markdown, and rendered in the page using an open-source markdown renderer `react-markdown`.

Using React and programming the site myself allows me total control over what the site can do, meaning that I don't need to deal with all the extra unwanted functionality provided by a website hosting service, and I'm not bound by any restrictions placed on me by the hosting service. If I want something on my site, I write it in.
